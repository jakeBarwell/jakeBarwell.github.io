 I graduated from De Montfort University, gaining a 1st class degree with honours in Computer Security. Since then I have been working for ThinkOn helping to develop their digital offering [iCheev](https://www.iCheev.com) and on the companys public face [ThinkonGlobal](https://www.thinkonglobal.com).

<br/>

 My day to day work has me developing web applications utilising the LAMP stack in a local vagrant environment. My time is split between back end development and front end work. My back end work typically involves ZF1, ZF2 and more recently Slim3. On the front end I primarily work with DOJO JS, but we are just starting a new AngularJs project.

<br/>

 I have a deep understanding of web application security principles and I have shared my knowledge and enthusiasm for developing secure applications with my team.I introduced automated security testing into our CI process, encryption of sensitive data using hiera-eyaml and also perform manual audits. I enjoy thinking about the security implications of design and infrastructure decisions and I have liaised with multiple clients to complete their required security assessments.

<br/>

My degree gave me a breadth of knowledge that as helped me work in all areas of the development stack. I have a working knowledge of puppet and have contributed in setting up the configuration of hosts, I automated the configuration of our selenium environment. I have been constantly involved in the setting up of our AWS production environment and have good understanding of their services. I am strong linux user and have a good understanding of networking fundamentals.

<br/>

I am passionate about delivering the best product that I can and go above and beyond the role of developer. I have been instrumental in moving our team to a Kanban methodology that has given us all a clearer insight into our workflow. Alongside our designer we identified problems in our UX testing and strategy and have delivered a completely new workflow, utilising the [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) platform.
<br/>   
Collaborating with others is one of the best parts of my day, and to help improve ThinkOn's work I setup and introduced the team to Slack. Working with the team I setup the various required integrations and customised our very own hubot.
